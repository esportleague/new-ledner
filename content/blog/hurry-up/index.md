Annoyance when a customer says he doesn't want the product, and
The salesman continues to push his product.
That's when the worst switch begins: begging for
purchase...
I don't want to make a promise to you here that you just need to write 4-5
The most important thing is to sell to every customer, because there is no such option.
Instead, I want to show you a certain strength that works in
the client and is able to overcome his resistance to
purchase.

A power that inspires millions of people to make of superhuman effort
The power to sell without begging.
This is the Power of the Award, which is being promoted all time

When you apply this method of communication with your customers
you stop annoying them with pushy sales and start
to help them get what they want.
This is how they will perceive it.
