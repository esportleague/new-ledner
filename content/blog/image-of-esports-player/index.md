Once my older daughter asked for a small game console. I bought her a used PS3. But it turned out that it lacks a memory card, which games require to save the state - so called SAVE. Play Station and the card ??? WTF

I went to the big computer room and got this answer:

Okay, so I went to the store, where there are consoles and games!

But there's one question - aren't they limiting you?

There's Christmas for every sports game maniac. High-ranking tournaments in the League of Legends. Tournaments in Counter-Strike. Exciting matches in DOTA and many more games.
Rainbows six. PUBG. I don't even talk about Fortnite. 10 years old. Little kids want to be the highest...

It's the hottest computer play period ever. If you use that time well, your bank account will fill up nicely and survive a weaker start next year. If you don't take advantage of all the opportunities and ways of selling... Well, that's not gonna happen until... a while. A year or two? Who would know that.
