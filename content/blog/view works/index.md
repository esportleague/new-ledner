I gently told my caller how to get to me
to speak, but he didn't pay attention to it - that's the way the view works
into your product.
To be honest, he had me on a fork at some point,
3-4 sentences were enough and I would probably buy it.
You probably also have such moments when you have a customer on a fork.
But if you are a person with a strong interest in your product,
instead of in the client - you'll miss the moment and then it will be for
late.

## Why is it too late?

Because there comes a time when a potential buyer
makes a decision: it's not for me - or the opposite of that
It is too late to change it.
It may be stupid, but in this conversation of mine, in a certain
I thought to myself what my subscriber should write to me,
I would have bought it but it was too late.
When a customer says to himself: it's not for me, there's no turning back and no
arguments do not work.
I wrote to my would-be salesman twice directly,
that we are finishing the subject, because it is not for me.
And he kept trying.

## It was more and more annoying for me.

Although he was looking for a solution to the problem, he lost the most important
sales element: the customer, or me.
Because I wasn't wondering about the product anymore, but why
ignores me if I write that I am not interested?
Every sale has its dynamics.
Initiation when the customer is open to purchase and wants to know what
There it is.

Imagination when a customer tries to place a product in the context of
of your life to see if that's it.
